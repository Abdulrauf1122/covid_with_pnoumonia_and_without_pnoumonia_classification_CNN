Project Title: COVID Pneumonia Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Project Description:
This project involves the development of a deep learning model for the classification of images into two categories: “covid_with_PNEUMONIA” and “covid_without_PNEUMONIA”. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks, which have proven to be effective in areas such as image recognition and classification.

The project uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build and train the model. The model architecture includes a Conv2D layer, a MaxPooling2D layer, a Flatten layer, and two Dense layers. The model is trained on a dataset of images, which are preprocessed and fed into the model using TensorFlow’s ImageDataGenerator class.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify a new image into one of the two categories. The image is preprocessed and reshaped before being passed to the model for prediction.

Key Features:
Binary image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
